    "Not to mention the sight of it. It was strange because it still kind of looked like a dildo, with its weird green color."
    "And yet there it was, his cock, pistoning in and out of his lover, making them moan, filling him with more feeling than he'd ever experienced before."
    "Parvez felt engulfed, surrounded. Like his entire consciousness was narrowing down to that one part of his body that was being crushed with heat and warmth and pleasure."
    "He grabbed a fistful of Terry's long pink cloud of hair to anchor his fucking better. Terry groaned, low and guttural."
    "When Parvez's orgasm came he felt a wave ripple through his cock but nothing came out. It felt muted, strange, oddly unsatisfying. He kept pounding into Terry."
    t "Shit, did you cum? I think I felt it."
    p "Ah I just, I don't know--I need more--"
    "He pounded Terry for what felt like hours. The thick squish of their ass smacking against Parvez's belly over and over again became a kind of hypnotic music."
    "Terry came but Parvez kept going, possessed. He rutted into him like an animal, pressing Terry into the sheets soaked with their cum."
    "Surely their neighbors could hear the slap of their bodies meeting, the way Terry was howling with Parvez's fingers dug into his ass, driving himself in and in and in."
    "Eventually, after Terry had cum three times, they had to stop."
