    "It's still kind of weird to think about."
    "Starting testosterone last year had made him really horny,"
    "but it was nothing like the experience of having a hard, throbbing dick wake him up every day."
    "He could feel his pulse in it, beating in time with his headache. He wet his dry lips."

            "He was usually able to pee out of it, which was strange, because he was only able to cum through it once a month."
            "When he had taken a look at himself down there with a mirror, he had figured out that the plant was indeed growing out of his vagina, but there was a secondary tube connecting it to his urethra."
            "He was grateful for this, because the sensation of having to sit down and pee on his own dick would have been, just, so gross."
            "Imagining it causes him to soften enough to be able to piss."
            "Even then, it's pretty gross to think of the plant, like, siphoning his piss so that he can let it out."
            "Was there some kind of capillary action that drew it up through his cock? Is that why it was hard to pee while he was hard? Or was it just as hard for cis guys?"

    "Parvez had bought it for Terry a few years before. It seemed like the toy of theirs that got the most use ..."
    "... alongside a butt plug that he had bought them as a joke that looked like a gnome."
    "Terry always took care to clean the gnome plug and replace it in the sex toy drawer right away, but it was always clean of dust, unlike some of the other toys in there."
    "On the other hand the stroker was frequently hanging out in the tub, recently used and ready to be used again."
    "Parvez finished peeing and walked over to poke it."
    "It was squishy, soft."
    "He put his finger to the entrance, and then pushed inside."
    "The nubs moved around his finger, almost drawing him in."

    "Disgusting as it was to admit it, that was always something he kind of enjoyed in hentai. The weird x-ray cutaways they would show."
    "Mostly he just liked seeing dicks, even censored ones."
    "And now he couldn't stop thinking about seeing his dick squishing around that toy, like a weird jelly slug."
    "He resolved to ask Terry about it the next day."
    "Then he left the bed to jerk off on the couch, before returning to lay next to a soundly sleeping Terry."

    "He pours lube on his dick--it's so cold."
    "He squishes the toy against his head."

    "When he can't cum--which is most of the time--his desire doesn't really feel like a ramping up to the point of orgasm, the way it used to, or how it does when he can cum."

    "The plant that Ahmed had given Parvez sits on the kitchen counter while he writes on his laptop at the table."
    "It's growing really well. This is of course no thanks whatsoever to Parvez--Terry is the one who takes care of all their houseplants."
    "Parvez kind of feels the same way about indoor plants as he does about indoor cats: sure, it's cool to see them up close, but they always seem like they wish they could be outside."
    "Parvez kind of wishes he could be outside today too. He's been in the house all week, but it's absolutely pouring rain."
    "The wind rattles the windows, and thunder crackles only a few seconds after each flash of lightning."
    "He's actually been working on a project the last few weeks, feeling a rare burst of creativity."
    "Usually the routine of feeling bad for himself and working nights at the grocery store consumes all his energy."
    "But somehow now that he's been going out and meeting people and having experiences, the ideas have started flowing again."
    "He realizes that he hasn't typed anything for several minutes, just staring out the window with his hands frozen on the keyboard."
    "He looks at his screen. He's actually written a lot today. Time for a break, he thinks."
    scene balcony with pushleft
    "Parvez gets up from the kitchen table and rolls himself a joint."
    "It's too miserable to actually be outside, so he opens the door to his balcony and just stands in the doorway."
    "The wind makes it feel cooler outside than in the stuffy house."
    "He's been writing a story about a guy who decides to bear a pregnancy for a group of aliens."
    "Now that he's reflecting on it, it's kind of obvious where the inspiration for this had come from."
    #cgs??
    "In the story, the man is out running in a field, when a UFO comes down and abducts him along with a couple of cows."
    "The aliens are able to connect with his consciousness directly, read his mind, and they are able to abandon language and really communicate with each other."
    "They are from a species, the Limonians, whose home planet had become desolate and unliveable after aggressive industrialization and resource extraction."
    "Their people began traveling their solar system, in the Lemon Slice nebula, extracting resources from their local planets, and then spreading further and further out."
    "Unheeding of the destruction they were causing, they kept seeking out new planets to strip mine and abandon. Over time their species spread far apart across many galaxies."
    "After many centuries of wandering space, the Limonians had become sterile. Their species is propagated by cloning, but their genetic stock was weakening."
    "This band of aliens had split off almost 200 years ago and traveled many light years further away than any Limonian had gone before."
    "They were considered freaks and heretics by the others, abandoning their sterile and comfortable world in search of another species to increase their genetic diversity ... to breed, and maybe even find love."
    "Our human man, Tiresias, upon being abducted by the Limonians and experiencing this story broadcast directly into his mind, breaks down in tears."
    "The depth of the Limonians' yearning for connection to other species, and to raise young of their own, stuns him."
    "In the end before they even directly ask he volunteers to carry a baby for them."
    "The aliens share their genetic material through their long fingers. Over a dozen of them take turns penetrating Tiresias, filling him with their seed."
    "When they are inside him the neural connection is even deeper, he can feel them feeling him, their wonder at his warm, moving body surrounding them."
    "The feeling of their fingers in his cunt, the feeling of his cunt around their fingers, the awe of their alien minds touching a being so earthly and pulsing, alive, overwhelmed his senses."
    "The aliens fucked him for what felt like days, until they were sure that he was successfully impregnated."
    "Then they left him alone in a room on their ship. He had everything he could want, replicated food, human television from every era, before and after his time, and yet he was alone."
    "The Limonians had injected him with hormones that would speed up the gestational process. After only a week he was showing the pregnancy, but he was desperately lonely."
    "Even though he couldn't see them alone in his room, he reached out through the neural connection to see if he could speak to someone."
    "A voice returned to him, undescipherable."
    "Tiresias reached out again."
    "A young alien came to see him, slimmer and smaller than the rest. Tiresias can't tell its gender, when he asks the Limonians don't understand what he's asking about. They all appear the same."
    "He and the new alien become companions over the weeks when Tiresias' belly swells."
    "They become lovers, of a kind, touching each other's bodies and exploring the link that grows between them through their neural connection."
    "Tiresias has never experienced a being that can feel him, whose connection with him is so seamless and intimate, and he knows he will never experience it again."
    # end cgs??
    "Parvez can't decide how the story will end. Whether Tiresias will safely lay dozens of alien eggs, or whether the alien babies will burst through his belly, killing him. In that case maybe the Limonians' avoiding Tiresias was to protect him from that knowledge."
    "There's something appealing to Parvez about the idea of being a blessed sacrifice, fattened up for slaughter."
    "Parvez's joint is burning down, the cherry of it almost to his fingertips."
    "He stubs it out against the doorframe of the balcony and goes back inside."
    "He looks at his laptop and then glances away, at the plant Ahmed had given him."
    "It's moving slightly in the soft breeze from the still-open door, waving toward the fresh air. Parvez thinks he knows how it feels."
    "Inexplicably, he yearns to touch the plant."
    "He walks over and pokes a fleshy frond of it with his finger."
    "It curls back around his finger, like it's holding his hand. Parvez leans down to kiss it."
    "He's not sure what he's doing, but he knows this plant can sense him."
    "Maybe because it's Ahmed's, he can feel it. That would be cool, but probably unlikely."
    "Still, almost without thinking, Parvez finds himself grabbing the plant and taking it into his bedroom."
    scene bed with pushright
    "Parvez sits on the ground by the foot of the bed, placing the plant between his outstretched legs."
    "Even though it's much smaller than the one in the woods, it starts reaching toward him."
    "It twines its leaves around his dick, poking and exploring it, as if the plant knows that they are the same."
    "His dick, between its monthly emissions, is solid and feels swollen."
    "The plant twining around it is both of it and apart from it. It gets frustrated, jabbing at his cock like it's waiting for it to react."
    #cg
    "Then the plant seemingly loses interest and moves toward his ass."
    "When it's done fucking him, the plant seemingly goes dormant."
    "Parvez lays on his bedroom floor with a sense of emptiness where it had been filling him."
    "He sends the picture that he snapped while it was inside him to Ahmed."
